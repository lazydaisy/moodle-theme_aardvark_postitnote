#AARDVARK POSTIT NOTE

##12th December 2016

Aardvark Postit Note is a simplified version of Aardvark Postit with the addition of some new settings to add three Postit Notes to the drop-down profilebar. If you allow your users to Dock Blocks you will notice that the dock is now at the top of the page, so if you dock all the blocks on each page they will stay at the top of the page until you release them, giving you more space on the page, this especially useful for Administrators and Teacher.
